## Installation

You can install this plugin via the Packages manager in Atom itself or manually through the terminal

```bash
$ apm install jsonlint
```

## Usage

JSON Lint is by default validating on save (this can be changed in the package settings), you can also execute it by hitting `cmd+alt+l` or run `Jsonlint` from the Command Palette.

If you like you can even set it to validate while typing in the package settings.
